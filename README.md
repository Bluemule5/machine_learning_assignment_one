Simple Linear Regression: You are given the following training data

| X | Y |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0 | 5.1 |
| 2.5 | 6.1 |
| 3.0 | 6.9 |
| 3.5 | 7.8 |
| 4.0 | 9.2 |
| 4.5 | 9.9 |
| 5.0 | 11.5 |
| 5.5 | 12.0 |
| 6.0 | 12.8 |

1.	Model Y as a linear function of X. 
2.	Use gradient descent learning algorithm to learn model parameters.  Use an appropriate 
    learning rate and convergence criterion. Plot J for the learning duration.

Multiple Linear Regression
You are given the following training data.  

| X1 | X2 | y |
| --- | --- | ---|
| 0 | 1 | 0.6 |
| 1 | 0 | 2.4 |
| 1 | 1 | 1.6 |
| 2 | 1 | 3.4 |
| 1 | 2 | 0.5 |

Model Y as a linear function of X1and X2.  Assume that the learning rate is 0.01, and initial values of the parameters are [1, 1, 1].  
1.	Illustrate gradient descent algorithm by updating the parameters 3 iterations.  
2.	Code and run the algorithm till convergence.

You must submit the following
1.	Source code
2.	Output â€“ Initial and final values of parameters; regression line and data; plots of J
3.	Your observations and conclusions .
